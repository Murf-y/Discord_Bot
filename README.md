# KloD
KloD is  Discord BotBUILT on top of [DsharpPlus library](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus).
## Requirements
- .NET Core 3.x runtime or higher.
- .NET Core 3.0 SDK
- and preferably visual studio.
#### Make sure to add a config.json file in `bin/Release/netcoreapp3.0/` after u build the solution.
the config.json file will contain the token and the prefix example:
```
   {
      "token" : "the token here",
      "prefix" : "the prefix here"
   }
```
thats it, now u can run the .exe file generated after the build.
